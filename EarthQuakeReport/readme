Earthquake report app

Project that I did for fun to learn about Networking with the Android framework.

It shows the latest earthquakes that have happened in the world. You can choose the minimum magnitude to show and in which order to sort them.

Uses JSON parsing, HTTP requests and threads, since all the network operations are done in the background.
